About Bus Booking System 
Moving on, this bus ticket booking system project in PHP focuses mainly on online ticket reservations and route management. Also, the system displays all the lists of available routes according to their prices. In addition, the system allows managing bus information too. This project is divided into two categories: Admin, and Customer. In an overview of this web application, the role of the customer is pretty simple. A customer can only check the ticket’s status using PNR. Here, the admin has to provide the PNR code. As result, the customers can have their bus ticket details such as route, seat, timing, and other information. Besides, all other features fall upon the hands of an administrator.


Admin Panel and Route, Bus Management
On the other hand, an admin has full control over the system. An admin has the right to manage the proper flow of the system. With it, the very first step of the management side falls upon the arrangement of bus records. The administrator has to provide few details such as the number/name of the bus. Also, the admin has the right to manage bus routes by providing various details. Indeed, these details include the names of cities, selection of available buses, the total cost with departure date and time. And lastly, now the administrator has to provide the customer’s details such as the name of the customer and contact details. For the record, each route and customer record will have its own unique id, which is required later on in the booking section.


Online Bus Booking and Seat Availability
Coming towards the booking section, an admin has to maintain each booking information. The system requires a number of details in order to book a bus. The admin has to select a customer, routes, and select seat numbers. Indeed, the above-mentioned information helps to auto-fill certain other fields. Such as the selection of customer auto-fills every detail of customer, similarly the selection of routes auto-fills the name of source and destination. At last, the system automatically displays the total cost for the trip as soon as he/she selects a seat. The system automatically generates PNR codes after bookings. Also, the selection of seat numbers takes away the seat availability of that particular number. To make sure of these, the user can check the seat availability of buses by provided the bus number. The occupied seats are indicated using red color, whereas the remaining ones are default colors.


User Management, Earnings and PNR
In general, the system prepares a summary highlighting the details of particular routes, buses, customers. Of course, this whole section contains total earnings too. Also, the administrator can add users for the management of the system by providing the required details. Meanwhile, the user can use the PNR code from the client-side in order to check the ticket’s status and its details. Furthermore, the user can also print out the ticket details. Besides, the administrator can search details using the passenger’s ticket number and have an overview of total earnings with other fields too.
